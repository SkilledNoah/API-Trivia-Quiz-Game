# API-Trivia-Quiz-Game

This project is a Python-based trivia game built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The game fetches questions dynamically from an external API, allowing users to customize their experience by selecting the difficulty level, category, and number of questions.

Key features include:

Customizable Settings: Users can define their preferred difficulty, category, and the number of questions, which are then used to generate a unique quiz experience each time.

API Integration: The game integrates with an external trivia API to retrieve real-time questions, ensuring a fresh and varied set of challenges for every session.

Tkinter-based GUI: The graphical user interface is developed using Tkinter, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience. The interface displays questions, manages user input, and provides immediate feedback on correct or incorrect answers.

Scoring System: The game includes a scoring system that tracks the userâ€™s progress, displaying the score at the end of the quiz.

Modular Design: The application is structured with modularity in mind, separating concerns across different classes such as question_model, quiz_brain, data, options, and ui. This makes the codebase more maintainable and extendable.

This project demonstrates my ability to create interactive applications that leverage APIs, apply OOP design principles, and develop user interfaces using Python.
